The Spiral Matrix problem involves traversing a 2D matrix in a spiral order, starting from the top-left corner and moving in a clockwise direction. The task is to return all elements of the matrix in the order of their traversal. Here's a more detailed explanation:

# Problem Statement:
Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

# Example:
Consider the following 3x3 matrix:

1 2 3    
4 5 6        
7 8 9        

The spiral order traversal of this matrix would be [(1, 2, 3,) (6, 9,)( 8, 7, )(4, 5)].


Sure, let's break down and evaluate different aspects of your code, including problem-solving, workflow, algorithm, and complexity.

Problem Solving:
Your code appears to solve the Spiral Matrix problem by traversing the matrix in a spiral order, starting from the top-left corner and moving in a clockwise direction.
The logic for traversing the matrix is implemented correctly, considering the steps for traversing the upper outer row, outer column, lower outer row, and the second (middle) row.
You have correctly used slices to store the elements during traversal.

Workflow:
Your workflow involves creating a matrix, initializing an empty slice, and then traversing the matrix following the specified order.
The use of comments is helpful for understanding each step in your code.

Algorithm:
The algorithm correctly follows the steps for spiral order traversal of the matrix.
The use of loops to iterate through the matrix and append elements to the slice is appropriate.
The code is well-structured and easy to follow.

Complexity:
Let's analyze the time complexity. The time complexity of your algorithm is O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because you are traversing each element of the matrix once.
The space complexity is O(m * n) as well, as you are using a slice to store the elements during traversal.

Feedback:
Your code is clear, and the logic is well-implemented.
It's good practice to generalize the traversal steps into a function that can be reused for matrices of different sizes. This would enhance code reusability and maintainability.
Consider handling edge cases, such as matrices with a single row or column.
