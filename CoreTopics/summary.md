Array :
Array contains sequence of elements of same type and of fixed size. means ater defining the size of array we can not change the size of array.
1. first we declare array by (using var arr := [4]int) inside the racket we keep the size of array and outside the bracket we define the type of element
2. after declaration we have to initialize the array. we can initialize the array in two ways (first while declarations and second y using index)
3. we can access/ print the element of array in two ways(one  using index and second is y using for loop means iterations)
4. we can take the element of arra from user y using for loop

Slice :
slice is a sequence of element with dynamic size and same type. means size of slice can e changed  dnamically.
1. slice can decalred in two way (one way is using make function or second is  same as array declaration)
2. we can also find the capicity of slice y using cap function
