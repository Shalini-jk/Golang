1. Problem Understanding:
The problem is well understood. The goal is to count the number of lines in a given file ("sample.txt").
You successfully open the file, read it line by line, and count the lines.

2.Algorithm:
The algorithm is straightforward. You use a bufio.NewReader to read lines and increment a counter for each line.
The algorithm is effective for the task at hand.

3.Code Structure and Readability:
The code structure is clear and easy to follow.
Variable names are meaningful (e.g., openfile, reader, count).
The use of defer for closing the file is a good practice.
The loop for reading lines is concise.

4.Complexity:
The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of lines in the file. You iterate through each line once.
The space complexity is O(1), as you use a constant amount of memory for the counter and variables.

5.Error Handling:
Error handling is implemented well when opening the file, checking if there's an error.
However, the error returned by reader.ReadString should be checked within the loop. This would help distinguish between reaching the end of the file and other potential errors.

6.Suggestions for Improvement:
Improve error handling within the loop by checking the error returned by reader.ReadString.
Add comments to explain the purpose of the code and any important steps.
Consider using scanner.Scan() instead of reader.ReadString('\n') for better error handling and flexibility.
