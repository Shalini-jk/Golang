1.Problem Understanding:
he problem is well understood. The code is designed to copy the contents of one file to another.
User input is used to specify the names of the source and destination files.

2.Workflow and Code Structure:
The workflow is clear and follows a logical sequence: open the source file, create/open the destination file, copy the contents, and print a success message.
The code structure is straightforward, making it easy to follow.

3.Algorithm:
The algorithm uses io.Copy to efficiently copy the content from the source file to the destination file.
The algorithm is appropriate for the task at hand.

4.Complexity:
The time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the source file. io.Copy efficiently reads and writes data in chunks.
The space complexity is O(1) as the memory usage is constant.

6.Error Handling:
The code includes error handling for opening the source and destination files.
The user is informed if the specified files do not exist.
However, there's room for improvement in error handling for other potential issues, such as permission errors or file not found during the copy operation.

 Suggestions for Improvement:
Add more comprehensive error handling, including checking for errors during the copy operation using io.Copy.
Consider providing more informative error messages to help users understand the issue.
