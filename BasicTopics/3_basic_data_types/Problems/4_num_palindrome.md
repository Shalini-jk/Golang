1.Working Code:
The code successfully checks whether a given number is a palindrome.
The logic for reversing the number and the subsequent comparison is correct.
The program outputs the reversed number, which can be useful for verification.
    Rating: 9 out of 10

2.Problem Understanding:
You have a clear understanding of the problem, which involves checking whether a number is a palindrome.
The use of a temporary variable (temp) to store the original number for later comparison is appropriate.
    Rating: 9 out of 10

3.Algorithm:
The algorithm correctly reverses the given number and compares it with the original number to determine if it's a palindrome.
The use of a loop to extract digits and reverse the number is well-implemented.
    Rating: 9 out of 10

4.Complexity:
The complexity of the algorithm is linear (O(d)), where d is the number of digits in the input number.
The loop iterates through each digit once.
The space complexity is constant as it uses a fixed number of variables regardless of the input size.
