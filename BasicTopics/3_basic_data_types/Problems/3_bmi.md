Your code is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator in Go. Let's break down the feedback and provide separate ratings for each aspect:

1. Understanding of the Problem:
You correctly identified the task of calculating BMI based on user input for height and weight.
However, the prompt messages to the user are placed before taking input, so the initial values of height and weight are not meaningful in the prompts.
    Rating: 8 out of 10

2.Algorithm:
The algorithm follows the correct BMI formula: BMI=weightheight2BMI=height2weight​.
The use of parentheses in the formula ensures the proper order of operations.
    Rating: 9 out of 10

3.Complexity:
The complexity of the algorithm is constant (O(1)O(1)) because it involves a fixed number of arithmetic operations regardless of the input size.
    Rating: 9 out of 10

4.Working Code:
The code is functional and calculates the BMI as intended.
The use of fmt.Scan for user input is appropriate.
The Printf statement for printing the BMI with two decimal places enhances readability.
    Rating: 8.5 out of 10

5.User Input Handling:
The prompts for user input are placed before actually taking the input, resulting in misleading messages.
It would be better to place the prompts after declaring variables and before scanning input to make the interaction clearer.

Overall Rating: 8+9+9+8.5+7.55≈8.458+9+9+8.5+7.5​≈8.4 out of 10

Your code is solid, but there's room for improvement in terms of user interaction and prompt placement.
