1. User Input Validation:
It might be a good idea to validate user input to ensure it's one of the expected choices 
(Rock, Paper, or Scissors). This can prevent unexpected behavior if the user enters something 
else.

2. Function Decomposition:
While your code is concise, you might consider decomposing parts of it into separate 
functions to improve readability and maintainability. For example, you could have a function 
to get the user's choice, a function to get the computer's random choice, and a function to 
determine the winner.

3. Consistency in Output:
Ensure consistency in your output messages. For example, consider changing "you win !!" to "
You win!" for uniformity.
