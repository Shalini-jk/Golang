Your code is a simple implementation of a number guessing game, and it looks like it would work
for its intended purpose. Here are some feedback points:

1. User Interaction: The code prompts the user to guess a number and takes user input using 
fmt.Scan. This is a simple and clear way to interact with the user.

2. Random Number Generation: You correctly seed the random number generator with the current 
time to get different random numbers in each run.

3. Feedback for Correct Guess: The code provides feedback to the user, stating whether their 
guess is correct or incorrect. This is good for user engagement.

4. Readability: The code is straightforward and easy to understand. However, consider adding 
comments to explain the purpose of certain parts of the code, especially if you were to share 
it with others.

5. Looping Mechanism: Currently, the code doesn't have a loop to keep prompting the user 
until they guess the correct number. You might want to implement a loop to allow multiple 
attempts until the correct guess.
