our code is a classic implementation of the FizzBuzz problem, and it looks correct for the 
specified requirements. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. Looping Mechanism: The for loop is well-structured and iterates through numbers from 1 to 100,
inclusive. This is the expected range for a FizzBuzz problem.

2. FizzBuzz Logic: The FizzBuzz conditions are correctly implemented. It prints "Fizz" for 
multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5, and the 
number itself for all other cases. The order of conditions ensures that "FizzBuzz" is printed 
for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.

3. Readability: The code is concise and easy to read. The indentation is consistent, and the 
logic is straightforward, making it accessible for others to understand.

4. Output Formatting: The output is formatted correctly, with each result printed on a new 
line. This makes the output clear and easy to interpret.

5. Efficiency: The code is efficient in terms of time complexity. It iterates through the 
range once and checks the conditions for each number.

6. No Redundant Code: There is no redundant code, and the conditions are logically organized.


Overall, your code meets the requirements of the FizzBuzz problem and follows good coding 
practices. It's a clean and well-implemented solution.
