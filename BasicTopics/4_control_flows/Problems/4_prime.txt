Your code attempts to check whether a given number is prime or not. Here are some feedback 
points:

1. Variable Naming and Formatting: Your variable names are clear and descriptive, which is good.
The formatting of your code is also reasonable.

2.Input Validation: You check if the input is less than 1 and declare it as not a prime number.
 This is appropriate as prime numbers are defined for integers greater than 1.

3. Logic for Checking Prime: You correctly use a loop to check divisibility from 2 to the 
square root of the input.However, your loop condition might be simplified. You can iterate up 
to issqu directly without creating a separate variable issqu.

4.Print Statements:Your print statements provide useful information for understanding the flow 
of the program, such as displaying the square root of the input.

5. Logic Improvement: Since you've initialized prime to true and only set it to false if a 
factor is found, you can invert the condition in the final if statement. It might make the 
code a bit cleaner
