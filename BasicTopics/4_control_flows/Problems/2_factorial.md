    Rating: 9 out of 10

4.Complexity:
The time complexity of the factorial calculation loop is O(n)O(n), where nn is the input number.
The space complexity is constant (O(1)O(1)) as only a few variables are used.
The algorithm is efficient for small values of nn but becomes slow for large values due to the factorial growth.
