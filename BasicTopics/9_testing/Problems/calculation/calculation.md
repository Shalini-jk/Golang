Certainly! Let's break down the code and evaluate it based on different aspects.
Problem Solving:

1.Modularity: The use of a separate operation package for each mathematical operation is a good practice. It promotes modularity and code organization.

User Interface: The user interface is simple and clear, allowing the user to choose the desired operation.

2.Workflow and Algorithm:
Loop Structure: The use of an infinite loop for the calculator menu is appropriate, ensuring the program continues to run until the user decides to exit.
Switch Statement: The switch statement efficiently handles the user's choice, directing the program to the appropriate mathematical operation.

3.Test Cases:
 Missing Tests: It appears that there are no explicit test cases provided in the code. Proper unit tests for each mathematical operation would be beneficial to ensure the correctness of the functions.

4.Complexity:
Readability: The code is generally readable and easy to follow. However, adding comments to explain the purpose of the code blocks, especially for beginners or other developers, would enhance readability.

Code Duplication: There is a bit of code duplication in the switch statement. Extracting the common part, such as printing the menu, outside the loop could reduce redundancy.

Suggestions and Ratings:

    Overall Code Structure: 4/5
        The use of packages and a modular approach is commendable. However, some improvements can be made in terms of code duplication and comments.

    Workflow and Algorithm: 4/5
        The loop and switch statement are well-structured. Adding comments to explain the purpose of each case and improving code duplication could enhance this.

    Test Cases: 3/5
        Consider adding explicit test cases, especially for the functions in the operation package, to ensure their correctness.

    Complexity and Readability: 4/5
        The code is generally readable, but adding comments and addressing code duplication would improve its clarity.

Additional Suggestions:

    Error Handling: Consider adding error handling for user input. If the user enters a non-integer or an invalid choice, the program should handle it gracefully.

    Unit Testing: Create separate unit tests for each function in the operation package to verify their correctness.

    Documentation: Consider providing some documentation for your package, explaining the purpose of each function and how to use them.

Overall, your code is well-structured and functional. Addressing the mentioned suggestions would make it even more robust and maintainable.
